1. Generate a key with your GCP or AWS provider. PX-Central uses this key to authenticate with your cloud provider and store and retrieve backup images from your cloud storage buckets. 
2. From the home page, select **Settings**, **Cloud Settings** to open the cloud settings page. From this page youâ€™ll both configure a cloud account using the key you generated on step 1 and backup locations.
